# Explaining Code in Words
using [Srdjan's post](https://medium.com/how-i-started-learning-coding-from-scratch/advice-for-109-written-assessment-part-2-594060594f6e)

## General
20 questions, 3 hours (9 minutes per question.) Lot's of explaining code so
typing a LOT.

Use backticks for:
- method names `greetings`
- variable names `name`
- code lines you are referring to `line 1`

use paragraphs

## Variable Words: initialized, assign, referencing, reassign
- a variable is `initialized`
- you `assign` a *string* object with the value 'x' to a *local* variable
- a variable is `referencing` a *string* object with the value 'x'
- your `reassign` a *local* variable *a* to a different *string* object with the
value 'y'

#### example 1:

```ruby
a = 'hello'
b = a
a = 'goodbye'
```

On `line 1` of this code we are initializing the local variable `a` and
assigning a string object with value `hello` to it.

On `line 2` we are initializing the local variable `b` and assigning to
it a string object that the local variable `a` is referencing. Currently,
both of these local variables are pointing to the same object.

On `line 3` we are reassigning the local variable `a` to a different string
object with value `goodbye` so now, the local variable `a` is pointing to one
string object with value `goodbye` and the local variable `b` is pointing to
a string object with value `hello`.

## Method Words: defining, parameter, call, pass in, argument, return value
- a method is `defined`
- a method takes a `parameter`
- a method is `called`
- an object is `passed in to` a method as an `argument`
  (Methods are defined with parameters, but they are called with arguments)
- a variable can be `assigned to the return value of a method call` (so a
 method has a `return value`)
- a method is `called on` a variabele

- `loop` is method of `Kernel` class
- a `do..end block` is passed as an `argument` to a `method call`
- You are going to use a lot of `passing in as an argument` on the test.
  Get used to that phrase.
- As of Ruby 2.4, the `Fixnum` and Bignum classes are gone, there is only
  `Integer`
- End by giving `output` and `return value`

#### example 2:

```ruby
def example(str)
  i = 3
  loop do
    puts str
    i -= 1
    break if i == 0
  end
end

example('hello')
```

On `line 1` we are defining the method `example` which takes 1 parameter. On
`line 10` we are calling the method `example` and passing in the string `hello`
as an argument to it.

On `line 2` of this code we are initializing the local variable `i` and assigning
to it an integer with value `3`

On `line 3` we are calling the method `loop` and passing in the `do..end` block
as an argument.

On `line 4` we are calling the method `puts` and passing in local variable `str`
to it as an argument.

On `line 5` the local variable `i` is reassigned to the return value of a
method call `Integer#-` on a local variable `i` with integer `1` passed to it as
an argument.

On `line 6` we are breaking out of the loop by using the keyword `break` if the
value of the object that local variable `i` is referencing is equal to 0.

On `line 10` we are calling the method `example` and passing in string `hello` as
an argument.

This code outputs string `hello` 3 times and returns `nil`.

Because (don't know if you have to give this part too):
We are calling the `puts` method inside of our method definition, and the last
line of code that is executed is returned since we donâ€™t have an explicit
return inside of the method definition. The method `puts` is outputting values
of objects, strings, integers and so on, so our method call on `line 10`
outputs the string `hello` 3 times, but returns `nil` since the last line of the
code in example method that is evaluated returns `nil`.
